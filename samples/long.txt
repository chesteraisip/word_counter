There are some comments I need to make regarding Example. I urge you to read the text that follows carefully, keeping an open mind, from the beginning to the end, and without skipping around. I further recommend that you take breaks, as many of the facts presented will take time to digest. A study of base-minded yobbos indicates broad political and ideological agreement on the use of force combined with a set of simple tactics to achieve their immediate goal: to violate international laws. What that means, simply put, is that his fatuous fibs often resemble an inverted fairy tale in that the triumph of innocence comes at the start and the ugly sisters of revisionism and plagiarism enter on stage in triumph for the final curtain. Example says that he needs a little more time to clean up his act. As far as I'm concerned, Example's time has run out. I suppose that's all I have to say in this letter. If there are any points on which you require explanation or further particulars I shall be glad to furnish such additional details as may be required.
